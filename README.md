# **Mathematical Foundations of Generative Neural Networks**

**Project Overview**
This repository explores the Mathematical Foundations of Generative Neural Networks (GNNs), delving into the theoretical and practical underpinnings of generative models. By integrating advanced mathematical concepts with state-of-the-art neural architectures, this project provides a comprehensive resource for understanding and implementing generative models such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), flow-based models, and diffusion models.
